			<h3>March 20th 2016 – Maïna and Stanley</h3>
			<p>
				As far back as he can remember, Stanley has always loved dancing and moving to music, whether solo or with others. He started couple dancing with salsa and rock'n'roll.
				<br/>
				He discovered West Coast Swing in 2009 and fell in love with the elegance, fluidity of this dance. He is teaching regular West Coast Swing classes in Rouen (France). Stanley has studied with Maxence Martin and has also obtained his Professional Dance Instructors Association certified by Mr Robert Royston.
				<br/>
				He is a renowned and well respected dancer, and having competed in some of the most prestigious event in Europe and US has now reached the final level : All Star.
				<br/>
				With his very friendly and sociable approach, Stanley is a well sought after teacher and judge, and wants to help people to share his passion for dance in both simplicity and feel. His purpose is to impart his knowledge with good humour and to help take people to the next level.
			<p>
				Maïna discovered West Coast Swing in 2013 and fell in love with this fluid and elegant couple dance. She then trained with Stanley and is influenced by dancers like Virginie Grondin and Torri Smith.
				<br/>
				In 2014, she started competing, in big events, and convinced judges by her elegant and sexy style. Her first place at BudaFest 2016 got her to the Advanced division.
				<br/>
				Maïna has assisted Stanley and Browly, two well-known All-Star dancers, when they came to Paris to give workshops. She loves sharing her passion with candor to help dancers having even more fun on the dancefloor.
			</p>
			We have the pleasure of having them teach us two workshops:
			<ul>
				<li>
					10.30 to 12.00 - Use his/her energy
				</li>
				<li>
					13.00 to 14.30 -  Give meaning to your dance
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				The afternoon of social dancing will begin just after the end of the 3rd workshop and will finish around 6.30pm.
				<br/>
				Workshops will be given in French, translation in English is possible if needed.
			</p>
			<p>
				You have to be a member of Brussels WCS asbl to take part in Brussels WCS Workshops and practice (10€).
